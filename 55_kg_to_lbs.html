            Are you taking a long time to convert <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/55-kg-to-lbs-convert-kg-to-lbs-kilograms-to-pounds">55 kg to lbs</a> (kilograms to pounds)? You have trouble remembering the formula to convert kg to lbs.<br>
            Don't worry, let us help you solve it easily and quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, you should know a little about the history of kilograms and pounds
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">A kilogram (symbol: kg)</span> is the International System of Units' fundamental unit of mass (SI). Currently, its definition is predicated on the Planck constant's fixed numerical value, h.
            The word kilogram is derived from the French "kilogramme," which was created by prefixing the Late Latin word "gramma," which meant "a tiny weight," with Greek terminology that meant "a thousand."
        <p>
            <span id="note">A pound (symbol: lb)</span> is a mass unit that is utilized by the imperial and US customary measuring systems. The precise weight of the international avoirdupois pound, or today's standard pound, 
            is 0.45359237 kilos. 16 avoirdupois ounces make up an avoirdupois pound.
        </p>
        <h2>Convert 55 kilograms to pounds (kg to lbs) with formula</h2>
        <p>
            You simply need to find the conversion factor between kilograms and pounds because both are weight or mass units. You can convert kilograms to pounds by multiplying the mass number by 2.2046226218 because 1 kilogram roughly equals 2.2046226218 pounds.
        </p>
        <p><span id="formula">Pounds = kilograms x  2.2046226218 (or 2.2 to reduce memory load)</span></p>
        <p>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            pounds = 55 * 2.2046226218 = 121.2541
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if we convert 55 kilograms to pounds, we get 121.2541 (lbs)
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the steps that you should follow in order to make the necessary calculations to convert 55 kilograms to pounds
