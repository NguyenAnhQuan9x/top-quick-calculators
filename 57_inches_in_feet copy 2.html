            Are you taking a long time to convert <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/57-inches-to-feet-how-tall-is-57-inches-to-feet">57 inches to feet</a>? You have trouble remembering the formula to convert inches to feet.<br>
            Don't worry, let us help you solve it easily and quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, you should know a little about the history of inches and feet
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">An inches</span> is a unit of measurement that adheres to the American Standard. One foot is equivalent to twelve inches. A further division into smaller units follows the inch. One inch is divided into 16 units. 
            One-sixteenth of an inch (1/16 inch) is the size of each unit. These 16 tiny units are combined into a larger unit called an inch, which is made up of 2/16ths (which is mathematically equivalent to an eighth). These two 1/8th units are 1/4 inch 
            wide (also commonly called a quarter of an inch). Again, two of these quarter-inch divisions equal one inch (two quarters are mathematically reduced to one inch). Next, three units of 1/4 inch (often referred to as "three quarters of an inch") 
            equal 3/8. Finally, 1 inch is equivalent to 4 1/4th units.
        <p>
            <span id="note">A foot (pl.feet)</span> is a standard length unit used in both the present US customary unit system and the Imperial system. 0.3048 meters are equal to one foot. Since the Roman and Greek eras, this length measurement has been used in Europe. 
            A yard is made up of three feet and 12 inches.
        </p>
        <h2>Convert 57 inches to feet with formula</h2>
        <p>
            You simply need to find the conversion factor between inches and feet because both are weight or mass units. The ratio between inches and feet can be understood simply that 1 inch is approximately 0.0833 feet and vice versa, 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 
        </p>
        <p><span id="formula">12 inches = foot<br>
            distance in feet = (distance in inches) / (12 inches/foot)</span></p>
        <p>
            So, to convert a measurement in feet to inches, all you need to do is multiply the number by 12 and if you need to convert from inches to feet then just divide by 12. This is an exact number, so if you're working with significant figures, it won't limit them.<br>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            feet = 57/12 = 4.75
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if we convert 57 inches to feet, we get 4.75 feet
        </p>
        </p>
