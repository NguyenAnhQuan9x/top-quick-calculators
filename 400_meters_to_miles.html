        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, you should know a little about the history of meters and miles
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="note">An inches</span> is a SI unit that is widely used as the primary measure of length and distance. A meter is one of the basic SI units, along with others like a kilometer or an inch. The distance a light travels in a vacuum over a period of 1/299,792,458 seconds is equal to one meter. 
            One meter, denoted by the SI letter m, is equal to 100 centimeters, or one thousandth (10-3) of a kilometer.<br>
            The meter, which is the SI unit of measurement, is used in many different contexts around the world to measure things like distance, height, length, and width. One prominent example is the United States, which frequently substitutes yards, inches, feet, and miles for meters in common usage.
        <p>
            <span id="note">A mile (symbol: mi or m)</span> is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement.It is currently defined as 5,280 feet, 1,760 yards, or exactly 1,609.344 meters.<br>
            The mile is still widely used in nations like the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Myanmar, and Liberia, as well as some other nations that are either US or UK territories or have historical ties with either country. 
            This is despite the fact that most nations have switched to the metric system and now express land distance in kilometers rather than miles.
        <h2>Convert 400 meters to miles with formula</h2>
        <p>
            You simply need to find the conversion factor between meters and miles because both are unit of Length. The ratio between meters and miles can be understood simply that 1 meter is equal to 0.000621 miles. 
        </p>
        <p><span id="formula">1 meter = 0.000621 miles</span>
        <p>
            So, to convert a measurement in meters to miles, all you need to do is multiply the number by 0.000621. This is an exact number, so if you're working with significant figures, it won't limit them.<br>
            Placing the values in the first formula, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
            miles = 400 * 0.000621 = 0.2484
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if we convert 400 meters to miles, we get 0.2484 mi
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the steps that you should follow in order to make the necessary calculations to convert 400 Meters to Miles
